'''Ana wanted to encode her texts so that no one else
read, and decode them for when she wanted to read. To do this, write a program that
contains these two options. Two integers and a text will be given
ending in dot. The first number refers to the option (1 to encode or 2
to decode) that the person wants and the second number will be a number n
referring to the encoding code, that is, given option 1, encode the text
“adding” the lowercase letters of the text to this value n so that the text is
encoded.
-> Example: if n = 2, the letter a becomes c, the letter n becomes p, the letter z becomes b, and so on
successively. Given option 2 with n = 1, the program must decode the text
reverting the text to the original, that is, the letter c becomes b, the letter a becomes z, and so on
successively. If an option other than the options above is given, the program
should print: "Invalid operation.".

ATTENTION: Capital letters should not be encoded. numbers and others
characters that may appear in the text should not be encoded.'''
